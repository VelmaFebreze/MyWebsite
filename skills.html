    <p class="more">I'm new to this "Software Development" career path, so I don't have any HTML, JavaScript, CSS skills.
      <br> 
    What I will say is that I am very hardworking and responsible. I think I got that from my dad. I'm also willing to work out solutions. I love solving problems.
      <br> 
    I love to help people. I think that's my biggest asset. I'm really good with helping people and their problems and I care a lot.
      <br> 
    Lastly, and probably one of the best ones is that I am willing to learn new skills. I love learning That's part
      <br> 
    of why I took this program.
      <br>
      <br> 
    I also can be very creative, which helps me to be able to style websites nicely. A good example of this would be some of my photos
      <br>
    I've taken and edited.
