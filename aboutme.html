    <p>I grew up in a small town in Virgina with my dad and my granny.
    Growing up in a small town made me realize how toxic it is when everybody knows everything about everybody.
    That is probably the thing I hated the most about my small town.

    Growing up in a small town made me realize how nice being away from everything was. You could see the stars at night, without worrying about
    all of the city lights being in the way. We didn't have many activites we could do during our free time,
    so most of the time, we went for a drive or even to the local Walmart.

      <p>When I found out we were moving in September of 2019, I was nervous, to say the least. I didn't want to leave my friends. I enjoyed my job I had. I didn't
     think I would ever be happy in a different state away from the majority of people I knew. I never would've guessed where it led me.
    When we moved, I rode with my dad for a bit. He was an OTR truck driver, so we went all around the US. I ended up visiting 46 of the 50 US states.

    3 years later and now I am working at Amazon in Prep. I'm in Glamazon,

    Now I am learning Software Development to possibly go a different direction in my career.
